# import and tidy column names
states_data <- import(here("data/states_all.csv"), setclass = "tibble") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

```

#### 1) In a new code chunk (separate from the chunk you used to import the data) reproduce the plot.

```{r part1.1_ash}

states_ash <- states_data %>%
  select(state, year, federal_revenue:local_revenue) %>%
  rename(Federal = federal_revenue,
         State = state_revenue,
         Local = local_revenue) %>%
  mutate(state = stringr::str_to_title(state)) %>%
  gather(key = type, value = revenue, Federal:Local) %>%
  group_by(state, year, type) %>%
  summarise(mean_revenue = mean(revenue, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(states_ash, aes(x = year, y = mean_revenue, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~type) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(y = "Revenue",
       x = "Year")
 
```

#### 2) Briefly Explain (outside the code chunk) a few things that could be done to improve the plot, and why. Iâ€™m less interested in the code here and more interested in why you feel the changes would improve the plot.

+ If our colleague wants to explore differences in revenue over time by *state*, I'm unsure why they would include the Department of Defense, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Virgin Islands (as well as US Virgin Islands?), Guam, etc. Not only that, but I have no idea what the following names refer to: As, Bl, Bie, Dd, Gu, Mp, Pr, and Vi. I would filter the dataset to only include the 50 US states. 
+ I'd also consider coloring the states by region (e.g., northwest, southwest, midwest, northeast, southest), rather than each state having its own color. 
+ Alternatively, we could just highlight and label the few states that stick out from the rest in each graph.
+ I'd transform the y-axis labels to enhance clarity.
+ I'd also ajust the x-axis to include a label every 5 years (e.g., 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015).

#### 3) In a new code chunk, make at least 3 revisions to the plot that you suggested above.
